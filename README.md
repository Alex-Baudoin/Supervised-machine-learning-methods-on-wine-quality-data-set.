# Supervised-machine-learning-methods-on-wine-quality-data-set.

The goal of this work is to predict wine quality using different supervised machine learning algorithms in order to compare their performance metrics.
The different fitted models were : 
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
- Logistic Regression (LR).

Their performances were compared in terms of the following metrics : Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, F1-Score and Precision.
